<h4>Project Code Graph</h4>
Network analysis is a useful to analyse any system with inter-dependent parts.<br/><br/>
On the right is an example system graph with three different systems (green squares). Each system can be connected to a database (blue circles) and / or libraries (red circles).<br/>
<br/>We see that two systems (A and C) both use the same shared database. There are also a number of isolated databases and libraries, these may indicate stand-alone systems, or dormant projects.
